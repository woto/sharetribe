    Make divider border between the elements without margins (only paddings)

    This is a little bit hacky-wacky solution, but it seems to work ok. The animation
    relies on the height of the animated element and it doesn't include the margins
    in the height. Best result for animation is when element doesn't have top/bottom
    margins
